Enter the amount of players and cards in the main menu, you can also optionally enter a search term as an image theme to get themed pictures. The pictures are retrieved from Flickr.

When the game starts the first player has to select two of the hidden cards, if they get two cards with the same picture they get a point and can play again. Otherwise the turn goes to the next player. Repeat until all cards are flipped. When all cards are flipped the player with the most pairs wins. Pairs can be seen in the sidebar to the left.
